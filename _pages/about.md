Welcome my friends! I am currently an Associate Professor at the School of Software Engineering, South China University of Technology. I received my Ph.D. degree from Schoole of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University in 2019, where I was fortunately supervised by Prof. Bo AN. I received my Bachelor's degree from College of Mathematics, Sun Yat-Sen University in 2014. I worked at Tencent Ads and Huawei Noah's Ark Lab from 2019 to 2023.

Generally, I am interested in developing intelligent agents to make decisions in complex and highly interactive environments. My research focuses on reinforcement learning, multi-agent systems, game-theoretic learning and their applications in real-world problems, including recommender systems, autonomous driving and robotics control. You can check my Google Scholar for more information. Please feel free to reach out!
