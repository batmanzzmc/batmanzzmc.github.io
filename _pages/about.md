Welcome my friends! I am currently an Associate Professor at the [School of Software Engineering](http://www2.scut.edu.cn/sse/), South China University of Technology. I received my Ph.D. degree from [Schoole of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/scse), Nanyang Technological University in 2019, where I was fortunately supervised by [Prof. Bo AN](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/boan). I received my Bachelor's degree from [College of Mathematics](https://math.sysu.edu.cn/), Sun Yat-Sen University in 2014. I also worked at Tencent Ads and Huawei Noah's Ark Lab from 2019 to 2023.

Generally, I am interested in developing intelligent agents to make decisions in complex and uncertain environments. My research focuses on reinforcement learning, multi-agent systems, LLM-based agents and generative decision models. You can check my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nLgORGMAAAAJ&hl=en) for more information. Please feel free to contact me!
