I am currently an Associate Professor at the <a href="http://www2.scut.edu.cn/sse/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">School of Software Engineering</a>, South China University of Technology. I received my Ph.D. degree from <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg/scse" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Schoole of Computer Science and Engineering</a>, Nanyang Technological University in 2019, where I was fortunately supervised by <a href="https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/boan" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Bo AN</a>. I received my Bachelor’s degree from <a href="https://math.sysu.edu.cn/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">College of Mathematics</a>, Sun Yat-Sen University in 2014. I also worked at Tencent Ads and Huawei Noah’s Ark Lab from 2019 to 2023.</p> <p>Generally, I am interested in developing intelligent agents to make decisions in complex and highly interactive environments. My research focuses on reinforcement learning, multi-agent systems, game-theoretic learning and their applications in real-world problems, including recommender systems, autonomous driving and robotics control.
